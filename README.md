# ※Unity-MOTHER-Shaders

This is a set of shaders inspired by the [background effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaL8m6dGros&list=PLgcu3QFgM8vn5DmVfdnKtti2wTySJv9bU) that are used in the [MOTHER series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series)).


It currently has:
> - Horizontal Oscillation
> - Vertical oscillation (for X coords, i know, kinda werid)
> - Vertical oscillation (for Y coords)
> - Interleaved oscillation
> - Scrolling
> - Interleaved oscillation + scrollin


## ※Usage
Just drag and drop the shader to the material that is applied to a surface, then you can select the texture/sprite you want and adjust parameters such as distortion scale, distortion speed, brightness, etc.

Thanks to [IsoFrieze](https://twitter.com/IsoFrieze) for the [great video](https://youtu.be/zjQik7uwLIQ) where it describes the behavior behind these effects, and to this [article](https://blog.mother4game.com/post/123598820159/update-2-focus-on-the-background-hey-folks) which explains the implementation and the mathematical function.
